# ADR-005: Development Environment Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

DiagnosticPro AI platform requires professional development environment supporting:

- Complex multi-modal media capture and processing features
- Integration with multiple Google Cloud services (Storage, Vertex AI, BigQuery)
- Existing Supabase Edge Functions and React/TypeScript frontend
- Critical requirement: "extremely professional developmental environment"
- Static CI/CD deployment pipeline for stability
- Testing across multiple devices and browsers for media features
- Quality assurance preventing customer issues

Current development context:
- Working Supabase + React + Stripe workflow ($4.99 payments)
- Need to add complex media processing capabilities
- Team requires clear development standards and procedures
- Quality must be maintained during rapid feature development

Requirements:
- Professional-grade development workflow
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Proper CI/CD with static deployments
- Cross-device testing for media features
- Code quality enforcement
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

## Decision

Implement **enterprise-grade development environment** with:

1. **Professional Development Workflow**
   - Structured branching strategy with feature branches
   - Mandatory code review process
   - Automated quality gates before deployment
   - Comprehensive testing at multiple levels

2. **Static CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing on all pull requests
   - Static analysis and security scanning
   - Automated deployment to staging environment
   - Manual promotion to production with rollback capability

3. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for all components and services
   - Integration tests for API workflows
   - End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
   - Cross-device testing for media capture features
   - Performance testing for video processing

4. **Quality Assurance Framework**
   - Code quality standards enforcement
   - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Documentation requirements for all features

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Professional quality**: Reduces bugs and customer issues significantly
- **Team productivity**: Clear standards and automation improve efficiency
- **Scalable development**: Supports team growth and complex feature development
- **Customer confidence**: Reliable, high-quality releases build trust
- **Competitive advantage**: Superior quality vs competitors rushing to market
- **Risk mitigation**: Prevents production issues and customer dissatisfaction

### Negative
- **Initial setup time**: Professional environment requires upfront investment
- **Development overhead**: Quality gates may slow initial development velocity
- **Learning curve**: Team needs training on professional development practices
- **Infrastructure costs**: Professional tools and environments require ongoing investment
- **Process complexity**: More sophisticated than "move fast and break things" approach

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Minimal Development Environment (Direct-to-Production)
- **Pros**: Fastest development velocity, minimal setup
- **Cons**: High risk of customer issues, unprofessional quality, no rollback capability
- **Reason for rejection**: Violates "customers don't get screwed" principle

### Option 2: Basic CI/CD (GitHub Actions only)
- **Pros**: Simple setup, good enough for small projects
- **Cons**: Limited testing capabilities, no cross-device testing, insufficient for media features
- **Reason for rejection**: Media capture requires sophisticated testing environment

### Option 3: Full Enterprise DevOps (Jenkins, Kubernetes, etc.)
- **Pros**: Maximum capability and scalability
- **Cons**: Massive overhead for startup, expensive, over-engineered for current needs
- **Reason for rejection**: Too complex and expensive for current team size

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Development Workflow
1. **Git Workflow and Branching**
   - Implement GitFlow with feature branches
   - Require pull requests for all changes
   - Enforce branch protection rules
   - Set up automated merging policies

2. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Configure ESLint with strict rules
   - Set up Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Implement TypeScript strict mode
   - Add pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
1. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
   - Unit test execution on all PRs
   - Integration test suite for API workflows
   - Cross-browser testing for media features
   - Performance testing for video processing

2. **Static Analysis and Security**
   - Code quality analysis with SonarCloud
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - License compliance validation

### Phase 3: Environment Management
1. **Environment Strategy**
   - Development: Local development with Docker
   - Staging: Production-like environment for testing
   - Production: Static deployment with rollback capability
   - Testing: Dedicated environment for QA and device testing

2. **Deployment Automation**
   - Automated deployment to staging on merge
   - Manual promotion gates for production
   - Automated rollback capabilities
   - Blue-green deployment for zero downtime

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance Framework
1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests: 80%+ coverage requirement
   - Integration tests: All API workflows covered
   - E2E tests: Critical user journeys automated
   - Device testing: Cross-platform media capture validation

2. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Performance monitoring with alerts
   - Error tracking and incident response
   - User analytics for feature usage
   - System health dashboards

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
```
TypeScript: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
Testing: Minimum 80% code coverage
Linting: ESLint strict rules, zero warnings allowed
Formatting: Prettier with automated formatting
Documentation: JSDoc for all public APIs
```

### Git Workflow
```
Main Branch: Protected, requires PR reviews
Feature Branches: Short-lived, single feature focus
Commit Messages: Conventional commits format
PR Reviews: Minimum 1 reviewer, automated checks pass
Merge Strategy: Squash and merge for clean history
```

### Testing Requirements
```
Unit Tests: Jest + React Testing Library
Integration Tests: Supertest for API testing
E2E Tests: Playwright for browser automation
Device Testing: BrowserStack for cross-platform
Performance Tests: Lighthouse CI for metrics
```

### Deployment Strategy
```
Development: Hot reload with local Docker stack
Staging: Automated deployment on merge to develop
Production: Manual promotion with approval gates
Rollback: Automated rollback capability within 5 minutes
```
