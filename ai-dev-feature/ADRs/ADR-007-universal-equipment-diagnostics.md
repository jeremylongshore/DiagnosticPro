- AI analysis lacks equipment-specific context and expertise
- Limited market addressable with automotive-only focus
- Competitive disadvantage against specialized diagnostic platforms

Market opportunity:
- Massive untapped market across all equipment categories
- No comprehensive cross-equipment diagnostic platform exists
- Professional services market values equipment-agnostic solutions
- Opportunity to become "universal diagnostic platform"

Technical challenges:
- Need dynamic form generation based on equipment type
- Require equipment-specific AI prompt engineering
- Must maintain diagnostic quality across diverse domains
- Complex taxonomy and categorization requirements
