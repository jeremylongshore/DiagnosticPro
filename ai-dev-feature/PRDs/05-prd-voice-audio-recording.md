# PRD: Voice-Only Audio Recording

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction/Overview

Add voice recording capability to the DiagnosticPro AI platform, allowing users to record audio descriptions of equipment problems, unusual sounds, and diagnostic context. This feature addresses the need for users to capture audio evidence and provide detailed verbal descriptions that are difficult to express in text, while converting speech to text for AI analysis.

## Goals

1. Enable users to record high-quality audio descriptions and equipment sounds
2. Implement automatic speech-to-text conversion using Google Cloud APIs
3. Provide intuitive recording interface with playback and quality controls
4. Support multiple audio recordings per diagnostic session with clear guidance
5. Ensure audio quality meets standards for accurate speech recognition
6. Convert audio to searchable text for AI diagnostic analysis

## User Stories

- **As an equipment owner**, I want to record the strange noise my machine is making so the AI can analyze the sound
- **As a technician**, I want to verbally describe complex diagnostic procedures that are hard to type
- **As a user**, I want to record multiple clips explaining different aspects of the problem
- **As a user**, I want to hear my recording before submitting to make sure it captured properly
- **As a user**, I want clear instructions on what types of sounds to record and why
- **As a user**, I want the system to warn me if my recording has too much background noise

## Functional Requirements

1. **Audio Recording Interface**
   - System must request microphone permission using browser APIs
   - System must record audio at highest quality for optimal speech-to-text accuracy
   - System must provide visual recording indicator (red dot, waveform, timer)
   - System must allow pause/resume functionality during recording
   - System must enforce maximum recording length limit (suggested: 10 minutes per clip)

2. **Recording Controls & Feedback**
   - System must show recording duration in real-time
   - System must provide large, clear start/stop/pause buttons
   - System must display audio levels/waveform during recording
   - System must allow users to restart recording if unsatisfied

3. **Audio Quality Management**
   - System must implement AI-powered audio quality analysis
   - System must detect and warn about:
     - Excessive background noise
     - Low volume/poor microphone input
     - Audio distortion or clipping
   - System must prompt for re-recording if quality is insufficient for speech recognition

4. **Playback & Review**
   - System must allow full playback of recorded audio before submission
   - System must provide basic playback controls (play, pause, scrub)
   - System must show audio waveform visualization during playback
   - System must allow deletion and re-recording of unsatisfactory clips

5. **Multiple Recording Support**
   - System must allow multiple audio recordings per diagnostic session
   - System must provide clear instructions for different recording types:
     - Equipment sound recordings (engine noise, grinding, clicking)
     - Verbal problem descriptions
     - Step-by-step procedure explanations
     - Context and background information
   - System must number/label recordings in sequence

6. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - System must automatically convert audio to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
   - System must handle multiple languages if detected
   - System must preserve both original audio file and transcribed text
   - System must indicate transcription confidence levels

7. **Storage & Integration**
   - System must store audio files in Google Cloud Storage staging area
   - System must maintain comprehensive metadata for each recording
   - System must link recordings to diagnostic submission ID
   - System must make transcribed text available for AI analysis

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time audio analysis during recording
- Audio editing or enhancement tools
- Music or non-diagnostic audio recording
- Integration with diagnostic workflow (due to AI confusion concerns with equipment sounds)
- Advanced audio filtering or noise removal
- Voice authentication or speaker identification
- Audio sharing between users

## Design Considerations

- Use large, touch-friendly recording controls for mobile users
- Implement clear visual feedback for recording states
- Show recording time limits and remaining time
- Provide helpful tips and examples for effective recording
- Use accessibility features for users with hearing impairments
- Design for one-handed operation on mobile devices

## Technical Considerations

- Use MediaRecorder API for cross-browser audio recording
- Implement proper audio codec selection for quality and compatibility
- Add client-side audio level monitoring for quality feedback
- Use WebRTC audio processing for noise suppression if available
- Implement chunked upload for large audio files
- Ensure proper security and privacy for audio data
- Handle various microphone types and quality levels

## Data Requirements

- Track comprehensive audio metadata: recording timestamp, duration, file size, sample rate
- Store speech-to-text transcription with confidence scores
- Maintain audio quality analysis results
- Link recordings to specific diagnostic context and session
- Track processing status through transcription pipeline
- Store user instructions acknowledgment and recording type classifications

## Acceptance Criteria

**Test Environment Success:**
- Audio recording works across different browsers and devices
- Speech-to-text conversion produces accurate transcriptions
- Audio quality validation correctly identifies poor recordings
- Multiple recording workflow functions properly

**Production Success:**
- Recordings capture clearly in various real-world environments
- Quality warnings help users create usable audio files
- Speech-to-text accuracy meets diagnostic analysis requirements
- Users successfully complete recording sessions without technical issues

**Quality Standards:**
- Speech-to-text accuracy > 95% for clear speech
- Audio quality validation detects problematic recordings
- Background noise warnings improve recording success rate
- User guidance reduces unusable recordings

## Success Metrics

- Recording completion rate > 90%
- Speech-to-text accuracy > 95% for submitted recordings
- User satisfaction with recording quality guidance
- Reduction in "unclear audio" processing issues
- Successful transcription rate > 98%

## Open Questions

1. What specific time limits should be set for different recording types?
2. Should the system provide real-time transcription preview during recording?
3. How should the system handle multiple languages in one recording?
4. Should there be different quality standards for speech vs. equipment sounds?
5. What level of background noise should trigger quality warnings?
6. Should users be able to add text notes to supplement audio recordings?
7. How should the system handle very quiet or very loud audio inputs?
8. Should there be templates or prompts to guide users on what to record?
