# PRD: File Upload Feature

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction/Overview

Add file upload capability to the DiagnosticPro AI platform, allowing users to upload any type of file (documents, images, videos, audio) as part of their $4.99 diagnostic submission. This feature addresses the need for users to provide comprehensive diagnostic data including existing documentation, photos, videos, and audio files that they may have already captured.

## Goals

1. Enable users to upload any file type to supplement their diagnostic submissions
2. Provide intuitive file selection and preview interface
3. Implement reliable file transfer with progress tracking and error handling
4. Integrate seamlessly with existing $4.99 diagnostic workflow
5. Route uploaded files to appropriate storage and processing systems

## User Stories

- **As an equipment owner**, I want to upload photos I took of my broken machine so the AI can analyze visual problems
- **As a technician**, I want to upload diagnostic reports and documentation to provide context for the AI analysis
- **As a user**, I want to upload multiple files at once so I don't have to repeat the upload process
- **As a user**, I want to see what files I've selected before uploading so I can verify I chose the right ones
- **As a user**, I want to see upload progress so I know the system is working and how long it will take

## Functional Requirements

1. **File Selection Interface**
   - System must provide a file input that accepts any file type
   - System must allow multiple file selection (drag & drop or click to browse)
   - System must display selected files in a preview list before upload

2. **File Validation**
   - System must enforce maximum file size limit (suggested: 50MB per file)
   - System must validate file integrity before upload
   - System must display file name, size, and type in preview

3. **Upload Process**
   - System must show upload progress indicator for each file
   - System must handle upload interruptions gracefully
   - System must allow users to remove files from upload queue before starting

4. **Error Handling**
   - System must display clear error messages for:
     - Files exceeding size limit
     - Network connectivity issues
     - Server-side upload failures
     - Unsupported file formats (if any restrictions added later)

5. **File Processing & Storage**
   - System must route files to Google Cloud Storage staging area
   - System must tag files appropriately for BigQuery filing system
   - System must initiate appropriate processing:
     - Images/videos → media storage with metadata tags
     - Audio files → speech-to-text conversion
     - Documents → text extraction if applicable

6. **Integration with Diagnostic Workflow**
   - System must associate uploaded files with diagnostic submission ID
   - System must include file metadata in diagnostic analysis context
   - System must maintain file references for AI analysis processing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time file editing or annotation
- File sharing between users
- File versioning or revision history
- Built-in file viewers (beyond basic preview)
- Advanced file compression or optimization
- Direct file upload to BigQuery (files go to staging first)

## Design Considerations

- Use drag-and-drop interface with fallback to click-to-browse
- Show file thumbnails for images where possible
- Implement clean, modern upload interface consistent with existing DiagnosticPro design
- Consider mobile-responsive design for phone/tablet uploads
- Use clear visual indicators for upload states (queued, uploading, complete, error)

## Technical Considerations

- Implement chunked uploads for large files to handle network interruptions
- Use Google Cloud Storage client libraries for reliable uploads
- Add client-side file type detection and validation
- Implement server-side virus scanning for security
- Consider implementing file deduplication to save storage costs
- Ensure proper CORS configuration for cross-origin uploads
- Add proper authentication/authorization for file access

## Success Metrics

- Upload success rate > 98%
- Average upload time < 30 seconds for typical file sizes
- User completion rate of diagnostic forms with files > 85%
- Reduction in support tickets related to "can't describe the problem"
- File processing accuracy rate > 95% (successful routing to correct storage)

## Data Requirements

- Track comprehensive file metadata: upload timestamp, file size, original filename, file type, user session ID
- Store file path/URL references in BigQuery filing system
- Maintain audit trail of all file operations (upload, processing, analysis inclusion)
- Link files to diagnostic submission IDs for complete traceability
- Track processing status and results for each uploaded file

## Acceptance Criteria

**Test Environment Success:**
- File upload functionality works in development/staging environment
- All file types can be successfully uploaded and processed
- Error handling works correctly for all edge cases
- Integration with diagnostic workflow functions properly

**Production Success:**
- Files upload successfully in real-world conditions across different devices/browsers
- Upload progress and confirmations work reliably
- Files are properly stored, tagged, and available for AI analysis
- Static CI/CD deployment pipeline maintains system stability

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Duplicate file uploads are detected and handled appropriately
- Browser crashes during upload allow recovery/resume
- Network timeouts trigger automatic retry mechanisms
- Large file uploads can be paused and resumed

## Open Questions

1. Should there be different file size limits for different file types?
2. What specific file types should be restricted for security reasons?
3. Should files be automatically deleted after diagnostic analysis completion?
4. How long should files be retained in the staging area?
5. Should users receive confirmation when files are successfully processed?
6. Should there be bulk upload limits (total MB per diagnostic session)?
