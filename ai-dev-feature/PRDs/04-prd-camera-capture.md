# PRD: Camera Capture for Documents and Equipment

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction/Overview

Add camera capture functionality to the DiagnosticPro AI platform, allowing users to take high-quality photos of physical documents and equipment directly through their device camera. This feature addresses situations where users don't have digital copies of important documents or need to capture real-time visual evidence of equipment problems for AI analysis.

## Goals

1. Enable users to take HD-quality photos of documents and equipment using device camera
2. Implement AI-powered photo quality validation with strict standards
3. Provide intuitive camera interface with preview and retake functionality
4. Automatically categorize captured photos using AI analysis
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing $4.99 diagnostic workflow
6. Ensure photos meet diagnostic analysis requirements for accurate AI processing

## User Stories

- **As an equipment owner**, I want to take photos of my broken machine so the AI can see exactly what's wrong
- **As a technician**, I want to photograph diagnostic codes on equipment displays for AI analysis
- **As a user**, I want to take pictures of warranty documents or manuals that I only have in physical form
- **As a user**, I want the system to tell me if my photo is too blurry so I can retake it before submitting
- **As a user**, I want to take multiple photos from different angles to give the AI complete visual information
- **As a mobile user**, I want to easily switch between front and back cameras as needed

## Functional Requirements

1. **Camera Access & Permissions**
   - System must request camera permission using browser APIs
   - System must handle permission denial gracefully with clear instructions
   - System must work across all major browsers and mobile devices

2. **Photo Capture Interface**
   - System must force highest quality/HD resolution for all photos
   - System must allow users to switch between front/back cameras on mobile devices
   - System must provide manual flash control for users
   - System must display live camera preview before capture

3. **Photo Quality Control**
   - System must implement AI-powered photo quality validation immediately after capture
   - System must enforce strict quality rules:
     - No blurry or out-of-focus images
     - Adequate lighting and contrast
     - Proper framing of subject matter
   - System must prompt for retake if photo quality is insufficient
   - System must provide specific feedback on quality issues (too dark, blurry, etc.)

4. **Photo Management**
   - System must allow multiple photos per session
   - System must show preview of each captured photo with retake/keep options
   - System must automatically categorize photos using AI (equipment, documents, diagnostic codes, etc.)
   - System must maintain photo order and context within diagnostic session

5. **Integration & Storage**
   - System must integrate with existing $4.99 diagnostic workflow
   - System must store captured photos in Google Cloud Storage staging area
   - System must maintain same metadata tracking as file uploads
   - System must link photos to diagnostic submission ID

6. **Error Handling**
   - System must handle camera access failures
   - System must provide fallback options if camera is unavailable
   - System must handle storage failures gracefully
   - System must allow retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Photo editing or filtering capabilities
- Manual photo categorization/labeling (AI handles this)
- Photo sharing between users
- Advanced camera controls (zoom, exposure, etc.)
- Video recording (separate PRD)
- Offline photo storage
- Photo printing or export functionality

## Design Considerations

- Use full-screen camera interface for better photo composition
- Implement large, easy-to-tap capture button for mobile users
- Show clear visual indicators for camera switching and flash status
- Display quality validation results with actionable feedback
- Maintain consistent design with existing DiagnosticPro interface
- Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities

## Technical Considerations

- Use MediaDevices.getUserMedia() API for camera access
- Implement progressive enhancement for browsers without camera support
- Add client-side image compression while maintaining quality standards
- Use machine learning models for real-time quality validation
- Implement proper error handling for various camera permission scenarios
- Ensure CORS and security compliance for image processing
- Consider battery usage optimization for extended photo sessions

## Data Requirements

- Track comprehensive photo metadata: capture timestamp, camera used (front/back), resolution, file size
- Store AI categorization results and confidence scores
- Maintain quality validation results and any retake history
- Link photos to specific diagnostic submission context
- Track processing status through the analysis pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Test Environment Success:**
- Camera access works across different browsers and devices
- Photo quality validation correctly identifies poor images
- AI categorization accurately classifies photo content
- Integration with diagnostic workflow functions properly

**Production Success:**
- Photos capture successfully in real-world lighting conditions
- Quality validation prevents submission of unusable images
- Photos are properly stored and available for AI analysis
- Users can complete photo capture process without technical issues

**Strict Quality Standards:**
- AI rejects blurry, dark, or poorly framed images
- System guides users to capture diagnostic-quality photos
- All accepted photos meet standards for accurate AI analysis
- Retake prompts are clear and actionable

## Success Metrics

- Photo capture success rate > 95%
- Quality validation accuracy > 98% (correctly identifying good/bad photos)
- User completion rate for camera capture sessions > 90%
- AI analysis accuracy improvement with high-quality photos
- Reduction in "unclear visual information" diagnostic issues

## Open Questions

1. Should there be a maximum number of photos per diagnostic session?
2. What specific quality thresholds should trigger retake prompts?
3. Should the system provide photo composition guides (grid lines, etc.)?
4. How should the system handle low storage space on user devices?
5. Should photos be automatically enhanced/optimized before analysis?
6. What offline capabilities should be provided if network is unavailable?
