- Speech-to-Text should leverage Google Cloud APIs established in AI integration PRD
- Follow existing component patterns and shadcn/ui styling for consistency
- Audio quality validation should prevent poor recordings from reaching customers
- Run tests with `npm test` or specify individual component/service test files
