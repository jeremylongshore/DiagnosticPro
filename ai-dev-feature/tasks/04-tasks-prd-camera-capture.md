### Notes

- Camera capture should integrate with existing DiagnosticForm and file upload architecture
- Use MediaDevices.getUserMedia() API for cross-browser camera access
- AI quality validation should use strict rules to ensure diagnostic-quality photos
- Follow existing component patterns and shadcn/ui styling
- Leverage storage infrastructure and AI API integration established in previous PRDs
- Run tests with `npm test` or specify individual component/service test files
