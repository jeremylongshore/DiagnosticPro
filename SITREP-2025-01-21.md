## 🎯 Architecture Transformation

### **BEFORE (Supabase Architecture)**
```
Customer Form → Supabase DB → Stripe Payment →
Supabase Edge Function → OpenAI Analysis →
PDF Generation → Email Delivery → Manual Download
```

### **AFTER (Google Cloud Architecture)**
```
Customer Form → Cloud SQL → Stripe Payment →
Cloud Run Webhook → OpenAI Analysis →
PDF to GCS → Status Polling → Direct Download (307 Redirect)
```

### **Key Improvements**
- **Performance:** Direct download vs email delivery (instant vs minutes)
- **Reliability:** GCS 99.9% uptime vs email delivery issues
- **Security:** Private bucket + signed URLs vs email attachments
- **Scalability:** Cloud Run auto-scaling vs Supabase function limits
- **Cost:** Pay-per-use vs fixed Supabase tier pricing

---

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Compute:** Cloud Run (2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 15min timeout)
- **Database:** Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 15 (db-f1-micro)
- **Storage:** GCS bucket (private, 90-day lifecycle)
- **Security:** Google Secret Manager (7 secrets)
- **Monitoring:** Cloud Logging + Health checks

### **API Endpoints Implemented**
- `GET /health` - Health check with system status
- `POST /api/diagnostics` - Create diagnostic submission
- `GET /api/diagnostics/{id}` - Retrieve diagnostic (with polling)
- `POST /api/checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session
- `GET /api/reports/{id}/download` - 307 redirect to signed URL
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe payment completion

### **Security Implementation**
- Firebase ID token verification on all endpoints
- Row-level security via userId filtering
- Firestore rules blocking client writes
- Private GCS bucket with 15-minute signed URLs
- IAM least-privilege permissions
