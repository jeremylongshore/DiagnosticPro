# DiagnosticPro AI Development Documentation

‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT PLATFORM MIGRATION**: Emergency 2-day migration from Lovable/Supabase to Google Cloud (Thursday-Friday deadline)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for the DiagnosticPro universal equipment diagnostic platform. These PRDs define the complete feature specifications for building a comprehensive AI-powered diagnostic system supporting everything from cell phones to spacecraft.

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Platform Migration (2-Day Timeline)

**Critical Documents for Emergency Migration:**
- **PRD-00**: Platform migration requirements (`00-prd-platform-migration.md`)  
- **Tasks-00**: Hour-by-hour breakdown (`../tasks/00-tasks-prd-platform-migration.md`)
- **ADR-000**: Architecture decisions (`../ADRs/ADR-000-platform-migration.md`)
- **Schema Mapping**: Firestore conversion (`../specifications/firestore-schema-mapping.md`)

**Migration Status**: Lovable/Supabase ‚Üí Google Cloud by Friday 6PM (absolute deadline)

**Note**: Template files have been removed. Master copies exist in other locations. Follow the structured approach documented here for feature development.

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Building complex features with AI can sometimes feel like a black box. This workflow aims to bring structure, clarity, and control to the process by:

1. **Defining Scope:** Clearly outlining what needs to be built with a Product Requirement Document (PRD).
2. **Detailed Planning:** Breaking down the PRD into a granular, actionable task list.
3. **Iterative Implementation:** Guiding the AI to tackle one task at a time, allowing you to review and approve each change.

This structured approach helps ensure the AI stays on track, makes it easier to debug issues, and gives you confidence in the generated code.

## DiagnosticPro Feature Development Workflow

The following PRDs define the complete architecture for our universal equipment diagnostic platform:

### Emergency Migration PRD (PRIORITY)

5. **Camera Capture** (`prd-camera-capture.md`) - Professional photo capture with quality control
6. **Voice Audio Recording** (`prd-voice-audio-recording.md`) - Audio recording with speech-to-text
7. **Video with Audio Capture** (`prd-video-audio-capture.md`) - Industry-first video diagnostic capability

### User Experience PRD

8. **UI/UX Design System** (`prd-ui-ux-design-system.md`) - Professional interface design for diagnostic workflows

### Implementation Task Lists

Each PRD has a corresponding detailed task list in the `/tasks/` directory:

**üö® URGENT MIGRATION:**
- `00-tasks-prd-platform-migration.md` (Emergency 2-day migration breakdown)

**Future Implementation:**
- `tasks-prd-storage-infrastructure.md` (67 tasks)

- `tasks-prd-ui-ux-design-system.md` (70 tasks)
- `tasks-prd-dynamic-diagnostic-input.md` (80 tasks)

**Total: 568+ detailed implementation sub-tasks + emergency migration**

### Architecture Decision Records

All major architectural decisions are documented in `/ADRs/`:

**üö® URGENT MIGRATION:**
0. `ADR-000-platform-migration.md` - Emergency migration architecture (Firestore, Vertex AI, Firebase Hosting)

**Future Implementation:**
1. `ADR-001-storage-architecture.md` - Hybrid storage strategy
2. `ADR-002-ai-processing-pipeline.md` - Multi-modal AI approach  
3. `ADR-003-video-processing-strategy.md` - Video diagnostics strategy
4. `ADR-004-security-privacy-framework.md` - Security architecture
5. `ADR-005-development-environment-strategy.md` - CI/CD approach
6. `ADR-006-ui-ux-design-strategy.md` - Design system strategy
7. `ADR-007-universal-equipment-diagnostics.md` - Universal platform architecture

### Implementation Phases

The platform development follows a systematic approach:

**üö® PHASE 0: EMERGENCY MIGRATION (Current Priority)**
