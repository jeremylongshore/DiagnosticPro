# PRD: UI/UX Design System for Diagnostic Media Platform

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction/Overview

Create a comprehensive UI/UX design system for the DiagnosticPro AI platform that supports professional diagnostic workflows across multiple media types (file upload, camera capture, audio recording, video with audio). The design system must balance accessibility for homeowners with professional capabilities for technicians, while maintaining industry-leading visual quality that justifies premium pricing.

## Goals

1. Create cohesive design language that builds trust and professional credibility
2. Design intuitive media capture workflows accessible to both consumers and professionals
3. Implement progressive disclosure patterns for complex diagnostic processes
4. Establish responsive design system working across all devices and orientations
5. Build accessible interface supporting users with diverse abilities and technical expertise
6. Create real-time feedback systems that guide users to success rather than highlight failures
7. Design conversion-optimized payment and trust-building interfaces

## User Stories

- **As a homeowner**, I want an interface that doesn't intimidate me when diagnosing my car problems
- **As a professional technician**, I want advanced features accessible without cluttering the basic interface
- **As a mobile user**, I want video recording controls that work perfectly with touch interaction
- **As a user with accessibility needs**, I want full functionality via screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **As a first-time user**, I want clear guidance on how to capture quality diagnostic media
- **As a paying customer**, I want confidence that this platform will solve my equipment problems

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Design System Foundation
- Comprehensive component library extending shadcn/ui for diagnostic-specific needs
- Professional color palette and typography system building trust and credibility
- Icon library with diagnostic-specific symbols and clear status indicators
- Responsive grid system optimized for media content and cross-device consistency
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all interactive elements

### 2. Media Capture Interface Design
- Progressive workflow design with guided onboarding for complex capture processes
- Full-screen capture modes with minimal distractions and professional controls
- Real-time quality feedback with constructive guidance and improvement suggestions
- Device-specific optimization (touch for mobile, precision controls for desktop)
- Visual hierarchy focusing attention on current step with clear next actions

### 3. Diagnostic Workflow UX
- Seamless integration of media capture into existing diagnostic form workflow
- Clear value proposition presentation for each media capture type
- Progress indicators and status communication throughout diagnostic process
- Error states with specific resolution guidance rather than generic error messages
- Success states and confirmations that build confidence in the diagnostic process

### 4. Cross-Device Experience Consistency
- Mobile-first design with touch-optimized controls for video/audio recording
- Desktop professional features including multi-monitor support and keyboard shortcuts
- Tablet interface optimization balancing mobile simplicity with desktop capability
- Consistent visual language and interaction patterns across all device types

### 5. Trust and Conversion Interface
- Professional payment interface with clear value proposition and pricing transparency
- Quality guarantee communication and refund policy presentation
- User testimonials and credibility indicators strategically placed
- Professional confirmation and receipt interfaces building confidence
- Clear progress communication during AI analysis processing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Custom video player development (use standard HTML5 video elements)
- Advanced image editing capabilities beyond basic preview and retake
- Social media integration or sharing features
- Multi-language localization (English-first implementation)
- Dark mode theme variants (professional light theme focus)
- Advanced accessibility beyond WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Design Considerations

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy
- Simple initial interface revealing advanced features as needed
- Contextual help and guidance without overwhelming the interface
- Expert shortcuts and advanced features accessible but not prominent
- Clear visual hierarchy guiding users through complex diagnostic processes

### Real-time Feedback Design
- Quality indicators using constructive language and visual cues
- Specific improvement suggestions rather than generic "try again" messages
- Visual feedback (green/yellow/red) with actionable guidance
- Celebration of successful captures to build user confidence

### Professional Credibility
- Clean, modern aesthetic appropriate for professional diagnostic services
- Consistent branding and visual identity throughout user journey
- Professional typography and spacing creating trustworthy appearance
- Strategic use of white space and visual hierarchy for clarity

## Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture
- Modular component design allowing independent updates and testing
- TypeScript interface definitions for all component props and states
- Consistent naming conventions and file organization
- Comprehensive Storybook documentation for all components

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for complex media capture components
- Optimized bundle sizes for mobile users with slower connections
- Efficient re-rendering patterns for real-time feedback components
- Progressive enhancement for advanced browser features

### Accessibility Implementation
- Semantic HTML structure for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels and descriptions for complex interactive components
- Keyboard navigation support for all functionality
- Screen reader testing and optimization

## Success Metrics

- User task completion rate > 90% for diagnostic media submission
- Customer satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for interface quality and ease of use
- Payment conversion rate > 85% after diagnostic submission completion
- Support ticket reduction > 50% related to interface confusion or difficulty
- Cross-device experience consistency rating > 95% identical functionality
- Accessibility compliance validation 100% WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Data Requirements

- User interaction analytics for interface optimization and A/B testing
- Device and browser usage patterns for responsive design optimization
- User feedback collection on interface clarity and ease of use
- Conversion funnel analysis for payment and diagnostic submission optimization
- Performance metrics tracking for interface loading and interaction speeds

## Acceptance Criteria

**Design System Completion:**
- Complete component library with diagnostic-specific elements
- Responsive design system tested across all target devices
- Accessibility compliance verified through automated and manual testing
- Professional visual identity consistently applied throughout platform

**User Experience Validation:**
- Usability testing completed with both consumer and professional users
- A/B testing shows improved conversion rates for new interface design
- Cross-device testing confirms consistent experience across platforms
- Performance testing meets loading time and interaction speed targets

**Integration Success:**
- Seamless integration with existing diagnostic workflow and payment system
- Media capture workflows tested and optimized for user success
- Real-time feedback systems provide constructive guidance
- Trust-building elements increase user confidence in payment decisions

## Open Questions

1. Should there be separate interface modes for consumer vs professional users?
2. What level of customization should be available for different equipment types?
3. How should the interface handle users with slow internet connections during media upload?
4. What offline capabilities should be included for areas with poor connectivity?
5. Should there be gamification elements to encourage complete diagnostic submissions?
6. How should the interface communicate AI analysis progress and estimated completion times?
7. What level of technical detail should be shown to users during the diagnostic process?
