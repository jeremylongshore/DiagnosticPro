# PRD: Video with Audio Capture

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction/Overview

Add comprehensive video recording capability to the DiagnosticPro AI platform, allowing users to record high-quality video with synchronized audio to demonstrate equipment problems, show diagnostic procedures, and provide visual context that static images cannot capture. This feature combines the benefits of visual documentation with audio narration for the most complete diagnostic information possible.

## Goals

1. Enable users to record HD/4K quality video with synchronized audio
2. Implement professional recording controls similar to Loom's interface
3. Provide AI-powered video and audio quality validation
4. Support multiple video recordings per session within reasonable limits
5. Automatically extract and transcribe audio tracks for AI analysis
6. Integrate seamlessly with existing $4.99 diagnostic workflow
7. Optimize file management for large video files in cloud storage

## User Stories

- **As an equipment owner**, I want to record my machine running so the AI can see and hear the problem simultaneously
- **As a technician**, I want to create video walkthroughs explaining diagnostic procedures step-by-step
- **As a user**, I want to record multiple short videos showing different aspects of the equipment issue
- **As a user**, I want to preview my video before submitting to ensure it captured the problem clearly
- **As a user**, I want the system to tell me if my video quality is too poor for accurate analysis
- **As a mobile user**, I want professional recording controls that are easy to use on my phone

## Functional Requirements

1. **Video Recording Setup**
   - System must request both camera and microphone permissions
   - System must record at highest available quality (HD/4K) for optimal diagnostic analysis
   - System must synchronize audio and video tracks properly
   - System must allow users to select initial camera (front/back) before recording starts
   - System must prevent camera switching during active recording

2. **Professional Recording Interface**
   - System must provide Loom-style recording controls:
     - Large, clear record/stop button
     - Pause/resume functionality during recording
     - Real-time recording duration display
     - Visual recording indicator (red border, pulsing dot)
   - System must show live camera preview before recording starts
   - System must display audio levels during recording

3. **Recording Management**
   - System must enforce intelligent time limits:
     - Individual video clips: 5-10 minutes maximum
     - Total session duration: Based on data collection needs vs. clarity requirements
   - System must allow multiple video recordings per diagnostic session
   - System must track cumulative file sizes and warn when approaching limits
   - System must provide clear naming/numbering for multiple videos

4. **Quality Validation**
   - System must implement AI-powered quality analysis for:
     - Video clarity and focus
     - Adequate lighting conditions
     - Audio clarity and volume levels
     - Proper framing of subject matter
   - System must prompt for retake if quality is insufficient for diagnostic analysis
   - System must provide specific feedback on quality issues

5. **Video Review & Processing**
   - System must allow full video playback before submission
   - System must provide standard video controls (play, pause, scrub, volume)
   - System must automatically extract audio track for speech-to-text processing
   - System must transcribe spoken content using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
   - System must preserve both video file and transcribed text

6. **Storage & Integration**
   - System must store videos in Google Cloud Storage staging area
   - System must integrate with existing $4.99 diagnostic workflow
   - System must optimize video compression while maintaining diagnostic quality
   - System must link videos to diagnostic submission ID with proper metadata
   - System must handle large file uploads with progress tracking

7. **Error Handling & Performance**
   - System must handle recording failures gracefully
   - System must provide clear error messages for:
     - Permission denied scenarios
     - Storage space issues
     - Network connectivity problems
     - Browser compatibility issues
   - System must implement chunked upload for large video files
   - System must allow pause/resume for interrupted uploads

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Live streaming or real-time video processing
- Advanced video editing capabilities
- Video filters or enhancement tools
- Screen recording functionality
- Video sharing between users
- Offline video storage
- Video conferencing or multi-user recording
- Advanced camera controls (manual focus, exposure, etc.)

## Design Considerations

- Implement full-screen recording interface for better composition
- Use familiar recording controls similar to popular platforms (Loom, Zoom)
- Show clear visual feedback for all recording states
- Optimize interface for both desktop and mobile usage
- Provide helpful tips and examples for effective diagnostic videos
- Ensure accessibility compliance for users with disabilities
- Design for one-handed mobile operation when possible

## Technical Considerations

- Use MediaRecorder API with proper codec selection for quality and compatibility
- Implement progressive video upload to handle large files
- Add client-side video compression while maintaining diagnostic quality
- Use WebRTC for optimal audio/video synchronization
- Implement proper memory management for long recordings
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility for video recording
- Add robust error recovery mechanisms for network interruptions
- Consider battery usage optimization for mobile devices

## Data Requirements

- Track comprehensive video metadata: recording timestamp, duration, resolution, file size, codec information
- Store audio transcription with confidence scores and speaker identification
- Maintain video quality analysis results and any retake history
- Link videos to specific diagnostic context and session information
- Track processing status through transcription and analysis pipelines
- Store user interaction data (pause/resume patterns, retake frequency)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Test Environment Success:**
- Video recording works across major browsers and devices
- Audio and video synchronization is maintained throughout recording
- Quality validation accurately identifies problematic recordings
- Multiple video workflow functions within file size/time constraints

**Production Success:**
- Videos record successfully in various real-world conditions
- Quality warnings help users create diagnostically useful content
- Video compression maintains analysis quality while managing file sizes
- Upload process completes reliably for large video files

**Professional Standards:**
- Recording interface provides smooth, professional user experience
- Video quality meets standards for accurate AI visual analysis
- Audio transcription accuracy supports diagnostic text analysis
- File management efficiently handles multiple large videos per session

## Success Metrics

- Video recording completion rate > 85% (accounting for complexity)
- Video quality validation accuracy > 95%
- Audio transcription accuracy > 90% for recorded speech
- Upload success rate > 98% for completed recordings
- User satisfaction with recording interface and controls
- Diagnostic analysis accuracy improvement with video evidence

## Open Questions

1. What specific time limits work best for diagnostic vs. file size balance?
2. Should the system provide recording templates or prompts for different equipment types?
3. How should the system handle very large video files that exceed typical upload limits?
4. Should there be different quality standards for different types of diagnostic videos?
5. What level of video compression is acceptable while maintaining diagnostic value?
6. Should users be able to trim or edit videos before submission?
7. How should the system handle devices with limited storage space during recording?
8. Should there be automatic backup/recovery for interrupted recordings?
