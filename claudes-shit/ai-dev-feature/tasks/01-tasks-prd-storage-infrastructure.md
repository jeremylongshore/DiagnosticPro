### Notes

- BigQuery audit script should connect to `diagnostic-pro-start-up` project and inventory all 266+ production tables
- GCS configuration should research enterprise best practices for media file organization
- Fresh database setup - no data migration needed (Supabase contains no production data)
- Use `npm test` to run all tests, or specify individual test files for focused testing
