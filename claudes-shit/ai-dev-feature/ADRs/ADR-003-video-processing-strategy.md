   - CDN integration for optimal delivery
   - Multi-resolution encoding for different scenarios
   - Intelligent compression algorithms

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Industry leadership**: First-to-market video diagnostic capability
- **Competitive moat**: Extremely difficult for competitors to replicate
- **Superior diagnostics**: Visual problems impossible to describe in text
- **Professional experience**: Loom-quality interface builds trust
- **Quality assurance**: Real-time validation prevents customer dissatisfaction
- **Scalable architecture**: Handles growth from startup to enterprise
- **Cost optimization**: Intelligent compression and tiered storage

### Negative
- **High complexity**: Most challenging feature to implement correctly
- **Performance requirements**: Significant CPU/GPU usage for real-time processing
- **Storage costs**: Large video files require substantial storage investment
- **Battery usage**: Mobile recording may drain device batteries quickly
- **Bandwidth requirements**: Large uploads may challenge slower connections
- **Cross-platform complexity**: Video recording varies significantly across devices

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Simple Video Upload (No Real-time Processing)
- **Pros**: Much simpler implementation, lower resource usage
- **Cons**: Poor user experience, high rejection rate, no quality control
- **Reason for rejection**: Competitors could easily replicate basic upload

### Option 2: Post-processing Only (No Real-time Quality Control)
- **Pros**: Simpler real-time requirements, easier to implement
- **Cons**: Customer frustration with rejected videos after payment
- **Reason for rejection**: Violates "customers don't get screwed" principle

### Option 3: Third-party Video Platform Integration (Loom, Zoom)
- **Pros**: Leverage existing professional platforms
- **Cons**: Loss of control, ongoing costs, integration complexity, no diagnostic optimization
- **Reason for rejection**: Reduces competitive advantage and increases costs

### Option 4: Audio-only with Static Images
- **Pros**: Much simpler technical implementation
- **Cons**: Misses visual diagnostic opportunities, less competitive differentiation
- **Reason for rejection**: Significant opportunity cost for visual problem diagnosis

## Technical Architecture

### Recording Flow
```
1. Device Capability Assessment
2. Permission Request (Camera + Microphone)
3. Stream Configuration (HD/4K optimization)
4. Real-time Quality Monitoring
5. Professional Recording Interface
6. Quality Validation Before Acceptance
7. Intelligent Compression
8. Progressive Upload to GCS
```

### Quality Validation Pipeline
```
Real-time Analysis:
- Video: Lighting, Focus, Framing, Motion
- Audio: Clarity, Volume, Noise, Sync
- Feedback: Immediate suggestions for improvement
- Enforcement: Quality thresholds before acceptance
```

### Storage Strategy
```
GCS Bucket Structure:
/diagnostic-videos/
  /hot/ (recent, frequently accessed)
  /warm/ (older, occasionally accessed)  
  /cold/ (archived, rarely accessed)
  /processing/ (temporary processing files)
```
