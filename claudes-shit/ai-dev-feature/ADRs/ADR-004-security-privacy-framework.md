# ADR-004: Security and Privacy Framework

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

DiagnosticPro AI platform handles sensitive customer data including:
- Equipment diagnostic information (potentially proprietary)
- Video recordings of customer facilities and equipment
- Audio recordings including customer conversations
- Photos of equipment and potentially identifying information
- Payment information and customer personal data

Security and privacy requirements:
- Protect customer proprietary information
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- Secure transmission and storage of all media files
- Audit trails for compliance and forensic analysis
- Camera/microphone permission management
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Enterprise-grade security for business customers

Current security context:
- Supabase provides Row Level Security (RLS) for database
- Stripe handles payment security compliance
- Need to extend security to new Google Cloud Storage integration
- Video/audio requires additional privacy protections

## Decision

Implement **comprehensive security and privacy framework** with:

1. **End-to-End Encryption Strategy**
   - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) for all data transmission
   - Encryption at rest for all stored media files
   - Client-side encryption for sensitive diagnostic data
   - Secure key management using Google Cloud KMS

2. **Access Control and Authentication**
   - Extend existing Supabase RLS to media file references
   - Google Cloud IAM for storage access control
   - Time-limited access tokens for media files
   - Principle of least privilege for all service accounts

3. **Privacy Protection Framework**
   - Automatic detection and blurring of personal information in videos
   - Consent management for recording and processing
   - Data retention policies with automatic deletion
   - Privacy-by-design for all new features

4. **Compliance and Audit Framework**
   - Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance measures
   - Data subject rights implementation (access, deletion, portability)
   - Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Enterprise trust**: Professional-grade security attracts business customers
- **Regulatory compliance**: Avoids legal issues and fines
- **Customer confidence**: Users trust platform with sensitive equipment data
- **Competitive advantage**: Superior security vs competitors
- **Scalable framework**: Supports growth into enterprise market
- **Risk mitigation**: Reduces data breach and liability risks

### Negative
- **Implementation complexity**: Sophisticated security adds development overhead
- **Performance impact**: Encryption and security checks may affect performance
- **Cost increase**: Security services and compliance measures add operational costs
- **User experience friction**: Additional consent and permission steps
- **Ongoing maintenance**: Security requires continuous monitoring and updates

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Basic Security (HTTPS + Database Security)
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, lower costs, faster development
- **Cons**: Insufficient for enterprise customers, regulatory risk, competitive disadvantage
- **Reason for rejection**: Inadequate for professional diagnostic platform handling sensitive data

### Option 2: Third-party Security Platform (Auth0, etc.)
- **Pros**: Proven security implementation, reduced development effort
- **Cons**: Additional costs, vendor lock-in, less control over security features
- **Reason for rejection**: Existing Supabase auth works well, cost optimization important

### Option 3: Minimal Compliance (GDPR/CCPA basic requirements only)
- **Pros**: Lower implementation cost, faster time to market
- **Cons**: Limits enterprise growth, potential regulatory changes, competitive weakness
- **Reason for rejection**: Security as competitive advantage for enterprise market

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Security Infrastructure
1. **Encryption Implementation**
   - Configure Google Cloud KMS for key management
   - Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
   - Enable encryption at rest for all GCS buckets
   - Enforce TLS 1.3 for all API communications

2. **Access Control Extension**
   - Extend Supabase RLS policies to media file references
   - Configure Google Cloud IAM roles for storage access
   - Implement time-limited access tokens for media files
   - Create service account security policies

### Phase 2: Privacy Protection
1. **Media Privacy Features**
   - Implement automatic PII detection in videos
   - Add privacy blurring capabilities
   - Create consent management system
   - Implement data anonymization features

2. **Data Lifecycle Management**
   - Define data retention policies
   - Implement automatic deletion schedules
   - Create data export capabilities for portability
   - Build secure data destruction procedures

### Phase 3: Compliance Framework
1. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Implement GDPR compliance measures
   - Add CCPA compliance features
   - Create data subject rights management
   - Build compliance reporting capabilities

2. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive audit logging
   - Create security monitoring dashboards
   - Add anomaly detection and alerting
   - Build incident response procedures

### Phase 4: Enterprise Security Features
1. **Advanced Security**
   - Implement video watermarking and tamper detection
   - Add advanced threat protection
   - Create forensic analysis capabilities
   - Build security analytics and reporting

## Security Architecture

### Data Classification
```
Public: Marketing materials, documentation
Internal: System configurations, analytics
Confidential: Customer diagnostic data, payment info
Restricted: Video/audio recordings, proprietary equipment info
```

### Encryption Strategy
```
In Transit: TLS 1.3 for all communications
At Rest: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
In Memory: Secure memory handling for sensitive operations
Key Management: Google Cloud KMS with rotation policies
```

### Access Control Matrix
```
Anonymous Users: Submit diagnostics only (no data access)
Authenticated Customers: Access own data only
Service Accounts: Minimal required permissions
Admin Users: Audit access with full logging
```

### Privacy Controls
```
Camera/Microphone: Explicit consent with clear purpose
Data Collection: Minimal necessary for diagnostic purpose
Data Processing: Transparent with user control
Data Retention: Automatic deletion after defined periods
```

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- Lawful basis for processing (legitimate interest for diagnostics)
- Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
- Privacy by design and by default
- Data protection impact assessments
- Breach notification procedures

### CCPA Compliance
- Consumer rights (know, delete, opt-out, non-discrimination)
- Privacy policy transparency
- Data sale opt-out (not applicable - no data sales)
- Consumer request handling procedures

### Industry Standards
- SOC 2 Type II compliance preparation
- ISO 27001 security management practices
- PCI DSS compliance (through Stripe)
- OWASP security guidelines implementation

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Data exfiltration attempts
- System vulnerability scans

### Audit Requirements
- All data access logged with timestamps
- User action trails for diagnostic sessions
- System configuration changes tracked
- Security incident documentation
