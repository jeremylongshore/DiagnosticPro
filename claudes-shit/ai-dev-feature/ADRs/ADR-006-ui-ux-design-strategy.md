**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

DiagnosticPro AI platform requires professional UI/UX design that:

- Supports complex media capture workflows (file upload, camera, audio, video)
- Provides intuitive interface for equipment owners AND professional technicians
- Maintains professional credibility for $4.99+ diagnostic services
- Handles sophisticated real-time feedback (quality validation, progress indicators)
- Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Competes with industry-leading platforms (Loom-quality video interface)
- Supports accessibility and diverse user capabilities

Current UI context:
- Existing React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui component library
- Working DiagnosticForm with Stripe payment integration
- Need to add complex media capture interfaces
- Users range from homeowners to professional mechanics
- Critical: Must not confuse or frustrate users during diagnostic process

Key UX challenges:
- Complex media workflows made simple
- Real-time quality feedback without overwhelming users
- Professional appearance building trust for payment decisions
- Cross-device consistency for mobile video recording
- Error handling that guides users to success

## Decision

Implement **professional diagnostic-focused UI/UX strategy** with:

1. **Progressive Disclosure Design Pattern**
   - Simple initial interface with advanced features revealed as needed
   - Guided workflows for complex media capture processes
   - Clear visual hierarchy focusing users on current step
   - Optional advanced features for professional users

2. **Professional Media Capture Interface**
   - Loom-inspired video recording interface for familiarity
   - Full-screen capture modes with minimal distractions
   - Real-time feedback with constructive guidance (not just error messages)
   - Professional controls that feel familiar to users of quality platforms

3. **Adaptive User Experience**
   - Device-aware interfaces (touch-optimized for mobile, precision controls for desktop)
   - User type detection (homeowner vs professional) with appropriate complexity
   - Progressive enhancement for advanced browser features
   - Graceful degradation for older devices/browsers

4. **Trust-Building Design Language**
   - Professional color scheme and typography building confidence
   - Clear pricing and value proposition presentation
   - Progress indicators and status communication throughout process
   - Success states and confirmations that reassure users

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Professional credibility**: Users trust platform with expensive equipment diagnostics
- **User success rate**: Intuitive interface reduces abandonment and support tickets
- **Competitive advantage**: Superior UX vs technical/clinical diagnostic tools
- **Market expansion**: Accessible to both consumers and professionals
- **Revenue growth**: Better UX increases conversion and payment completion
- **Scalable design system**: Consistent interface supports rapid feature development

### Negative
- **Design complexity**: Professional UX requires significant design and development effort
- **Performance considerations**: Rich interfaces may impact loading times
- **Cross-device testing**: Comprehensive UX requires extensive device testing
- **Maintenance overhead**: Professional design requires ongoing refinement
- **Design resource requirements**: May need dedicated UX/UI design expertise

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Technical/Clinical Interface (Diagnostic Tool Aesthetic)
- **Pros**: Familiar to professional technicians, information-dense
- **Cons**: Intimidating to homeowners, poor conversion rates, outdated appearance
- **Reason for rejection**: Limits market to professionals only, poor business model

### Option 2: Consumer-Only Interface (Simplified/Dumbed-Down)
- **Pros**: Easy for homeowners, high conversion potential
- **Cons**: Professionals may not trust oversimplified interface, limited diagnostic capability
- **Reason for rejection**: Reduces platform capability and professional market opportunity

### Option 3: Separate Interfaces (Consumer vs Professional)
- **Pros**: Optimized for each user type
- **Cons**: Double development effort, maintenance complexity, user confusion about which to use
- **Reason for rejection**: Development complexity without clear benefit

### Option 4: Third-Party UI Framework (Material Design, etc.)
- **Pros**: Proven design patterns, faster development
- **Cons**: Generic appearance, limited customization, may not fit diagnostic workflow
- **Reason for rejection**: Need specialized diagnostic interfaces, custom media capture UX
