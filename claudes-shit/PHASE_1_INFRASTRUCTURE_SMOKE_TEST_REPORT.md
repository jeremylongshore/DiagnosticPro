# **Phase 1 ‚Äî Infrastructure Smoke Test Report (UPDATED)**

**Date:** September 21, 2025
**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Cloud Build System Failure

## Critical Finding: Cloud Build Infrastructure Issue

**Root Cause:** Cloud Build service is consistently failing in the `diagnostic-pro-prod` project across all deployment methods:
- Firebase Functions v2 deployment: `Build failed with status: FAILURE`
- Cloud Run source deployments: `Building Container...failed`
- Multiple runtime versions tested (Node.js 18, 20)
- Multiple deployment approaches attempted

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Functions deployment failure
ERROR: Build failed with status: FAILURE
Build ID: d7ba8da3-d4d0-4ebb-87a0-b0fa32f5e604

# Cloud Run deployment failure
Building Container...failed
ERROR: Build failed; check build logs for details
```

**Impact:** Cannot deploy proxy service required for frontend-backend communication.

## Test Results Summary

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Cloud Run backend validation | ‚úÖ PASS | Service deployed and properly configured |
| 2. Organization policy enforcement | ‚úÖ PASS | Public access correctly blocked (401 Unauthorized) |
| 3. Service account configuration | ‚úÖ PASS | Created `functions-proxy-sa` with Cloud Run invoke permissions |
| 4. Proxy deployment | üî¥ BLOCKED | Cloud Build failures prevent all deployment methods |
| 5. End-to-end testing | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot proceed without working proxy |

## Successful Infrastructure Components ‚úÖ

### Cloud Run Backend
- **Service:** `fix-it-detective-backend`
- **URL:** `https://fix-it-detective-backend-298932670545.us-central1.run.app`
- **Status:** Healthy and properly configured
- **Image:** `gcr.io/diagnostic-pro-prod/fix-it-detective-backend:proxy-auth`
- **Service Account:** `298932670545-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Environment Variables:** All required variables set

### Security Configuration
- **Organization Policy:** ‚úÖ Blocking public access as intended
- **Service Account:** ‚úÖ `functions-proxy-sa` created with proper permissions
- **IAM Binding:** ‚úÖ Proxy service account can invoke Cloud Run
```bash
bindings:
- members:
  - serviceAccount:298932670545-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:functions-proxy-sa@diagnostic-pro-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/run.invoker
```

### Backend Testing (Developer-Only)
**Confirmed working with identity tokens:**
```bash
# This works for developers with gcloud access:
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token --audiences=$URL)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $URL/health
```

## Failed Deployment Attempts

### 1. Firebase Functions v2 (Original)
```bash
gcloud functions deploy apiProxy --gen2 --runtime=nodejs20 --entry-point=api
# Result: Build failed with status: FAILURE
```

### 2. Simplified Functions Framework
```bash
gcloud functions deploy apiProxy --gen2 --runtime=nodejs20 --entry-point=proxy
# Result: Build failed with status: FAILURE
```

### 3. Cloud Run Proxy Alternative
```bash
gcloud run deploy proxy-service --source=./direct-proxy
# Result: Building Container...failed
```

**Common Factor:** All failures occur during Cloud Build phase, not in code or configuration.

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Immediate Options

**Option A: Cloud Build Investigation**
- Check project quotas and billing
- Verify Cloud Build API permissions
- Review build logs in console for specific errors
- May require project admin intervention

**Option B: Alternative Deployment Methods**
- Pre-build container locally and push to GCR
- Use Firebase CLI instead of gcloud (requires Firebase CLI installation)
- Deploy from different project or environment

**Option C: Temporary Org Policy Exception**
- Request temporary relaxation of organization policy
- Enable public access to Cloud Run for testing phase
- Proceed with Phase 2-5 testing using direct backend access
- Deploy proxy as final step once Cloud Build is resolved

### Architecture Validation

**‚úÖ Confirmed Working:**
- Backend API endpoints properly configured
- Authentication flow designed correctly
- Service account permissions set up properly
- Security policies functioning as intended

**üî¥ Infrastructure Blocker:**
- Cloud Build service failures prevent all container deployments
- This is a project-level infrastructure issue, not an application issue

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Investigate Cloud Build logs in GCP console
2. **Short-term:** Request temporary org policy exception for testing
3. **Alternative:** Pre-build and push containers manually to bypass Cloud Build

**Phase 1 Status: INFRASTRUCTURE BLOCKED**

The application architecture is sound and the backend is working correctly. The blocker is purely infrastructure-related (Cloud Build service failure) preventing proxy deployment.

Should we:
1. Request temporary org policy exception to proceed with testing?
2. Investigate Cloud Build logs for root cause?
3. Try manual container build/push approach?

**STOP - Awaiting direction before proceeding to Phase 2**
