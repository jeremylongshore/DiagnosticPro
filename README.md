### Data Flow

**Complete Request Lifecycle:**

```
1. USER submits diagnostic form
   └─> POST /saveSubmission via API Gateway
       └─> Cloud Run saves to Firestore (diagnosticSubmissions collection)
       └─> Returns submissionId to frontend

2. USER completes Stripe Checkout
   └─> Stripe creates checkout session ($4.99)
       └─> Payment succeeds
           └─> Stripe fires checkout.session.completed webhook

3. Stripe webhook hits API Gateway
   └─> POST /stripeWebhook with signature verification
       └─> Cloud Run validates webhook signature
           └─> Creates order in Firestore (orders collection)
           └─> Triggers AI analysis

4. Cloud Run calls Vertex AI
   └─> Loads submission data from Firestore
       └─> Sends to Gemini 2.5 Flash with 15-section prompt
           └─> Receives 2000+ word structured analysis (20-30s)

5. Cloud Run generates PDF
   └─> PDFValidationSystem validates all 15 sections
       └─> Typography manager formats with proper pagination
           └─> Generates 12-15 page professional PDF
               └─> Uploads to Cloud Storage bucket

6. Cloud Run sends email
   └─> Fetches signed URL from Cloud Storage (valid 7 days)
       └─> Sends email with download link to customer
           └─> Logs email delivery in Firestore (emailLogs collection)

7. USER downloads report
   └─> Clicks email link
       └─> GET /getDownloadUrl via API Gateway
           └─> Cloud Run generates fresh signed URL
               └─> User downloads PDF from Cloud Storage
```

npm test               # Jest tests
npm run lint           # ESLint

# Backend
npm run dev            # Nodemon with hot reload
npm start             # Production mode
npm test              # Run tests

# Firebase
firebase emulators:start    # Local emulators
firebase deploy            # Deploy everything
firebase functions:log    # View logs

# Quality
npm run format        # Prettier formatting
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type checking
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run test suite
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# E2E testing
# 1. Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# 2. Use Stripe test cards
# 4242 4242 4242 4242 (success)
# 4000 0000 0000 9995 (decline)
```

### Diagnostic Test Script

```bash
# Verify README and workflow setup
./test-github-readme.sh
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Payment succeeded but no email"

```bash
# Check Cloud Run logs
gcloud logging read \
  "resource.type=\"cloud_run_revision\" \
  AND resource.labels.service_name=\"diagnosticpro-vertex-ai-backend\"" \
  --project diagnostic-pro-prod \
  --limit 50

# Check order status in Firestore
# Should see orderId with status: "paid"
```

### "PDF has blank pages" (Fixed in v2.0.0)

```bash
# Ensure you're on latest version
git pull origin main
cd 02-src/backend/services/backend
npm install
```

### "Stripe webhook fails"

```bash
# Verify webhook secret matches Stripe Dashboard
echo $STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Test webhook locally
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/stripeWebhook
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Firebase config missing | Check all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` vars in `.env` |
| CORS errors | Verify Cloud Run allows `diagnosticpro.io` origin |
| AI analysis timeout | Normal — Gemini takes 20-30s for full analysis |
| PDF generation slow | Expected — comprehensive 15-section report |
